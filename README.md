Project Title:
Eye Exercise

Description of Project (minimum of 20 words):
This project allowed us to practice our JavaScript and CSS skills to create a webpage. On this webpage, there is a set of eyes that follow your mouse as you hover around the screen. You need to assign the same style to both elements so the eyes move in a synchronized way. It is a great way to test these skills.

How to Run:
When you load the project page, move your mouse around the screen to see the eye pupils following your mouse around.

Roadmap of future improvements: 
I'd like to play around with more animation later. Perhaps a hand following the mouse around creating an avatar with full body movements.
